<!--                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">MANILA, Philippines — Jollibee Foods Corp. is grappling with a major data breach that potentially impacts millions of customers, with a cybercriminal claiming to have stolen data from the company's delivery operations and customer database.</p>-->
<!--                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The breach, which came to light on June 20, 2024, involves personal information of 32 million customers and 650 million records related to food delivery, sales orders, and transactions, according to reports from The Cyber Express and Manila Standard. The hacker, known by the alias "Sp1d3r," has also taken credit for other high-profile cyberattacks, including one on Snowflake.</p>-->
<!--                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Jollibee has initiated security measures in response to the breach, which also coincided with a security issue at Maxicare Healthcare Corporation’s Lab@Home booking service, a third-party service used by Jollibee Group. The specifics of the vulnerabilities exploited have not been disclosed by the company.</p>-->
<!--                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The incident underscores the growing need for robust cybersecurity strategies, especially in protecting sensitive customer data against sophisticated cyber threats. Jollibee is currently working with cybersecurity experts to assess the damage and strengthen its defenses to prevent future incidents.</p>-->
                            <!--                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The decision is a pivotal moment in the interpretation of the Second Amendment in the context of public safety and domestic violence, providing a robust basis for future legal interpretations and potential legislative measures aimed at curbing gun violence.</p>-->
<!--                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">On June 21, 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a federal law barring individuals with domestic violence restraining orders from possessing firearms, in the case United States v. Rahimi. Chief Justice John Roberts stated that the law aligns with historical practices of disarming those deemed a threat, consistent with the Court's Bruen decision which emphasizes historical tradition in gun regulation. This ruling clarifies that modern gun laws need only be broadly consistent with historical traditions, not exact replicas, providing a flexible framework for evaluating firearm regulations under the Second Amendment. This decision aims to enhance public safety by disarming individuals who pose a credible threat of physical violence to domestic partners.</p>-->
